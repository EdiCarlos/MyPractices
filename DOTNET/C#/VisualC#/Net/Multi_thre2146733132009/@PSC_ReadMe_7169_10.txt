Title: Multi threaded Port Scanner (Scans both IP and Port ranges)
Description: This application is like any other port scanner, it can scan a range of Ports (TCP) at a single ip address or accross a range of ip addresses.
Bare in-mind that this is my first project in C, i've only ever used VB before so expect alot of silly/nooby mistakes ;)
All feedback is welcome, thanks :)
