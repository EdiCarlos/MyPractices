Version History

Version 5.5 Beta 5 2010/06/03
* New: Small close button on top of the surf.aspx page to close the bar immediately.
* New: Manual update check from Administration UI page. Update your asproxy whenever you want without any problems. 
* Improved: The original url displyer float bar style now is placed in separate style-sheet file called "surfstyle.css".
	The style of surf.aspx page has migrated to that style-sheet file too.
* Improved: The solution for CookieContainer bug doesn't work in partial trust environments,
	so a fallback mechanism is added.
	Then the cookies will work on such servers, but buggy.
* Fixed: NetProxy default configuration.
* Fixed: Minor issue with urls which have parameters, when encode url option is disabled.
* Fixed: Invalid chars in download file name caused download to fail.(4shared.com, hotfile.com, ...)
* Fixed: Some encoded url detection is fixed. Caused ASP.NET Ajax to fail.
* Fixed: ASP.NET ViewState value detection due to preventing crashes.
* Fixed: [for mono] Fixed wrong directory separator character for Linux servers.
